Off-Broadway is a scripting app that allows users to choose actors, create scripts and watch them ‘acted out’ in a 2D theater.  A user begins by either selecting from a list of preexisting productions or creating a custom production.  If the user chooses to create a custom production, they first will write a script.

The user may choose to write a custom script from scratch or can select to have the script populated for a faster animated experience.  The user chooses which character will say the lines (charater a or character b), what the lines will be for each character (total of 5) and will choose a title.

Once the form is filled in, the user then selects actors to perform the script.  There is a small selection of actor from which to choose.  Afte the user selects the 2 users for the script, the productuon is complete.  The user can then select the recently created production from their collection of productions and see it animmated.
